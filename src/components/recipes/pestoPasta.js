                            <li>Cook the spaghetti or other pasta in large pot of salted boiling water according to package directions or until al dente. Drain the pasta and reserve 1 cup of the cooking water.</li>
                            <li>While pasta is cooking, add the roughly chopped garlic, toasted pine nuts and finely grated parmesan cheese to a food processor and process until smooth. Then, add in the basil. Pulse a few times until chopped then let it run as you drizzle the olive oil into the processor as it runs until emulsified. Season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, give a squeeze of lemon juice, and whiz again until combined. Taste for seasoning and adjust to your liking.</li>
                            <li>Toss the hot pasta with the pesto in a large bowl and add reserved cooking water Â¼ cup at a time or until saucy. Top with the cherry tomatoes and season with more salt and pepper if desired and garnish with more parmesan cheese.</li>
                        </ol>
